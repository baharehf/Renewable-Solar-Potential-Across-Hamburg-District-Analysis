## 📖 Project Overview

Hamburg has committed to becoming climate-neutral by **2045**, making renewable energy expansion a critical priority.

Although rooftops cover only about **10% of Hamburg's land area**, studies suggest they could provide more than **80% of the city's potential solar electricity supply**. However, solar potential is not distributed equally across districts due to differences in:

* Rooftop availability
* Building characteristics
* Solar suitability
* Urban density

This project performs a **building-level geospatial analysis** to identify which Hamburg districts offer the greatest opportunities for rooftop solar expansion.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

The primary objective of this project is to:

> Identify and rank Hamburg districts based on their rooftop solar potential using spatial analysis and geospatial data processing.

Specific goals:

* Analyze solar potential across more than 384,000 buildings.
* Aggregate building-level solar metrics at district level.
* Identify districts with the highest solar generation potential.
* Evaluate solar readiness and rooftop availability.
* Create interactive visualizations and dashboards for decision-making.
